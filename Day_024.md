# Day 24: Git Branch Create
Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media`. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

* On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch `xfusioncorp_media` from master branch in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media` git repo.

* Please do not try to make any changes in the code.


## Solution
SSH to Storage server and execute below commands
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media
git branch
```
> Verify branch is `master` shown in the output
> If branch is not `master`, then first checkout to master branch with `git checkout master`


Create a new branch
```sh
git checkout -b xfusioncorp_media
```
