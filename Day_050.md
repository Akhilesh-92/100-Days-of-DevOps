# Day 50: Set Resource Limits in Kubernetes Cluster
The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:

* Create a pod named `httpd-pod` with a container named `httpd-container`. Use the `httpd` image with the `latest` tag (specify as `httpd:latest`). Set the following resource limits:
  * Requests: `Memory: 64Mi`, `CPU: 250m`
  * Limits: `Memory: 128Mi`, `CPU: 500m`
> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
On jump host, create a pod.yaml file
```sh
kubectl run httpd-pod --image=httpd:latest --dry_run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```

Modify the resource limits and requests in pod.yaml file
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: httpd-pod
    labels:
        app: httpd_pod
spec:
    containers:
    - name: httpd-container
      image: httpd:latest
      ports:
      - containerPort: 80
      resources:
        limits:
           cpu: 500m
           memory: 128Mi
         requests:
           cpu: 250m
           memory: 64Mi
```


Create a pod
```sh
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```


Verify the pod creation 
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
