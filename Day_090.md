# Day 90: Managing ACLs Using Ansible

There are some files that need to be created on all app servers in Stratos DC. The Nautilus DevOps team want these files to be owned by user root only however, they also want that the app specific user to have a set of permissions on these files. All tasks must be done using Ansible only, so they need to create a playbook. Below you can find more information about the task.

Create a playbook named `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under `/home/thor/ansible directory` on Jump Server itself.

1. Create an empty file `blog.txt` under `/opt/security/` directory on app server 1. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide `read '(r)' permissions to group tony` (i.e entity is tony and etype is group).

2. Create an empty file `story.txt` under `/opt/security/` directory on app server 2. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide `read + write '(rw)'` permissions to `user` `steve` (i.e entity is steve and etype is user).

3. Create an empty file `media.txt` under `/opt/security/` on app server 3. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide read + write '(rw)' `permissions to group banner` (i.e entity is banner and etype is group).

> Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.


## Solution
Create a playbook named `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host and update below contents
```
---
- name: Create blank file on app server 1
  hosts: stapp01
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a blank file /opt/security/blog.txt
      file:
        path: /opt/security/blog.txt
        state: touch
    - name: Provide read (r) access to group tony
      acl:
        path: /opt/security/blog.txt
        entity: tony
        etype: group
        permissions: r
        state: present

- name: Create blank file on app server 2
  hosts: stapp02
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a blank file /opt/security/story.txt
      file:
        path: /opt/security/story.txt
        state: touch
    - name: Provide readwrite (rw) access to group steve
      acl:
        path: /opt/security/story.txt
        entity: steve
        etype: user
        permissions: rw
        state: present

- name: Create blank file on app server 3
  hosts: stapp03
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a blank file /opt/security/media.txt
      file:
        path: /opt/security/media.txt
        state: touch
    - name: Provide readwrite (rw) access to group banner
      acl:
        path: /opt/security/media.txt
        entity: banner
        etype: group
        permissions: rw
        state: present
```
