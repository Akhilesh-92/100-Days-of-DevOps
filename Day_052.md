# Day 52: Revert Deployment to Previous Version in Kubernetes
Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.

* There exists a deployment named `nginx-deployment`; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.


## Solution
1. Revert to the previous version
```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```


2. Verify the pods are in runnng state
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
