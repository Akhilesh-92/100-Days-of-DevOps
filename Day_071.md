# Day 71: Configure Jenkins Job for Package Installation
Some new requirements have come up to install and configure some packages on the Nautilus infrastructure under Stratos Datacenter. The Nautilus DevOps team installed and configured a new Jenkins server so they wanted to create a Jenkins job to automate this task. Find below more details and complete the task accordingly:

1. Access the Jenkins UI by clicking on the Jenkins button in the top bar. Log in using the credentials: username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.

2. Create a new Jenkins job named install-packages and configure it with the following specifications:

    * Add a string parameter named `PACKAGE`.
    * Configure the job to install a package specified in the `$PACKAGE` parameter on the storage server within the `Stratos Datacenter`.

Note:

1. Ensure to install any required plugins and restart the Jenkins service if necessary. Opt for `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on the plugin installation/update page. Refresh the UI page if needed after restarting the service.

2. Verify that the Jenkins job runs successfully on repeated executions to ensure reliability.

3. Capture screenshots of your configuration for documentation and review purposes. Alternatively, use screen recording software like loom.com for comprehensive documentation and sharing.


## Solution
Login to Jenkins UI with given credentials

*Go to Manage Jenkins -> Available Plugins -> SSH, SSH build agents, SSH agents, SSH Credentials -> Install -> restart Jenkins*

*Go to Manage Jenkins -> credentials -> click on system creds -> Add new credential -> Add username, password etc.*

*Go to Manage Jenkins -> System -> SSH sites -> Add hostname, port and deploy credentials.*

Create a new freestyle job -> This project is parameterized -> Add a String Parameter named PACKAGE

-> In Build Steps, select 'Execute shell script on remote host using ssh'
                           
-> Execute command "echo 'Bl@kW' | sudo -S yum install -y $PACKAGE" -> Save

*Go to freestyle job -> build with parameters -> Enter nginx -> build*

Verify the build is passed.
