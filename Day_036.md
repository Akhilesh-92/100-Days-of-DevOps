# Day 36: Run a NGINX Container on Docker
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 1. Complete the task with the following instructions:

* On Application Server 3 create a container named `nginx_3` using the `nginx` image with the `alpine` tag. Ensure container is in a `running` state.


## Solution
SSH to App server 3 and verify docker is installed or not
```sh
docker --version
```

Create a container on this app server.
```sh
docker run -d --name nginx_3 nginx:alpine
```

Verify container is in running state.
```sh
docker ps
```
