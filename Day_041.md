# Day 41: Create a Docker File

As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 1 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:

* Use `ubuntu:latest` as the base image.

* Install `apache2` and configure it to work on `6000` port. 


## Solution
1. SSH to App server 1 and create a Dockerfle by using command `sudo vi /opt/docker/Dockerfile` and write the below script
```sh
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y apache2 && \
    apt-get clean
RUN sed -i 's/80/6000/g' /etc/apache2/ports.conf && \
    sed -i 's/:80/:6000/g' /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
EXPOSE 6000
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```


2. Build the image, create a container and verify the apache connection
```sh
docker build -t ubuntu:latest
docker run -d -p 6000:6000 ubuntu:latest
http://localhost:6000
```
