# Day 26: Git Manage Remotes

The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/beta.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repository as per details mentioned below:

* In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps` repo add a new remote `dev_apps` and point it to `/opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git` repository.
* There is a file `/tmp/index.html` on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to `master` branch.
* Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.


## Solution
1. SSH to Storage server, check the remote and verify we are in `master` branch
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
git remote -v
git branch
```

2. Add new remote `dev_apps` and verify the remote creation
```sh
git remote add dev_apps /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git
git remote -v
```

3. Copy the file `/tmp/index.html` to the current folder, add and commit the file
```sh
cp /tmp/index.html .
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new index.html"
```

4. Finally push the committed changes to remote origin created
```sh
git push -u dev_apps master
```
