# Day 27: Git Revert Some Changes

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

* In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).
* Use revert demo message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.


## Solution
1. SSH to Storage server and cd into the repo `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo`
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
```

2. Verify git log to find initial commit message
```sh
sudo git log --oneline
```

3. Now, revert to the inital commit message
```sh
sudo git revert HEAD
git revert HEAD -m "revert latest commit due to issues"
sudo git push origin master
```
