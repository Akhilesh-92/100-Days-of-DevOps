# Day 30: Git Reset Hard
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:

* In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.

* Also make sure to push your changes.


## Solution
SSH to Storage server and cd into the repo
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
git checkout master
```

Verify the commit history
```sh
git log --oneline
```

Remove the commits to point back HEAD to the commit message `add data.txt file`
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~10
git push origin -f master
```

Verify there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file
```sh
git log --oneline
```
