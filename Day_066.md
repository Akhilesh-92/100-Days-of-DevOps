# Day 66: Deploy MySQL on Kubernetes

A new MySQL server needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster. The Nautilus DevOps team was working on to gather the requirements. Recently they were able to finalize the requirements and shared them with the team members to start working on it. Below you can find the details:

* Create a PersistentVolume `mysql-pv`, its capacity should be `250Mi`, set other parameters as per your preference.

* Create a PersistentVolumeClaim to request this PersistentVolume storage. Name it as `mysql-pv-claim` and request a `250Mi` of storage. Set other parameters as per your preference.

* Create a deployment named `mysql-deployment`, use any `mysql` image as per your preference. Mount the PersistentVolume at mount path `/var/lib/mysql`.

* Create a NodePort type service named `mysql` and set nodePort to `30007`.

* Create a secret named `mysql-root-pass` having a key pair value, where key is `password` and its value is `YUIidhb667`, create another secret named `mysql-user-pass` having some key pair values, where frist key is `username` and its value is `kodekloud_sam`, second key is `password` and value is `BruCStnMT5`, create one more secret named `mysql-db-url`, key name is `database` and value is `kodekloud_db8`

Define some Environment variables within the container:

  * name: `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: `mysql-root-pass` and key: `password`
  * name: `MYSQL_DATABASE`, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: `mysql-db-url` and key: `database`
  * name: `MYSQL_USER`, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: `mysql-user-pass` key key: `username`
  * name: `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, should pick value from secretKeyRef name: `mysql-user-pass` and key: `password`
> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



## Solution
1. On jump host, create pv.yamland pvc.yaml files with below details
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 250Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
-------------------------------------
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 250Mi
```

2. Create pv and pvc using yaml files and verify the status to be `Bound`
```sh
kubectl create -f pv.yaml
kubectl create -f pvc.yaml
```

3. Create dep.yaml file with details below
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: mysql-deployment
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql-deployment
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: mysql-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: mysql:latest
        name: mysql
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-root-pass
              key: password
        - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-db-url
              key: database
        - name: MYSQL_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user-pass
              key: username
        - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mysql-user-pass
              key: password
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/lib/mysql"
          name: mysql-pv
        resources: {}
      volumes:
      - name: mysql-pv
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: mysql-pv-claim
```


4. Create and verify deployment
```sh
kubectl apply -f dep.yaml
kubectl get deployment
```
