# Day 37: Copy File to Docker Container
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require completing a task on app server 1.

On Application Server 1 a container named `ubuntu_latest` is running, you have to copy the encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg` from docker hosts to container folder `/usr/src`.


## Solution
SSH to App server 1 and execute below commands
```sh
docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src/
docker exec -it ubuntu_latest ls -l /usr/src
```
