# Day 25: Git Branch Merge
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository `/opt/demo.git`. This repo is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

> Create a new branch nautilus in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` repo from master and copy the `/tmp/index.html` file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.


## Solution
1. SSH to Storage server
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
git branch
git checkout -b feature
cp /tmp/index.html .
```


2. Add and commit the copied file
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added a file index.html"
```


3. Merge feature branch into master (while staying on feature)
```sh
git merge master 
git push origin feature
git push origin feature:master (Files will be in master after git pull and feature merges into master)
```
