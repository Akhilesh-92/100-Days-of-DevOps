# Day 5: Install and Configuration Selinux

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter:

Install the required SELinux packages.
Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

## Solution
1. Install the required SELinux packages in App server 1
```sh
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils
```

2. Change the confguration settings in the following path
```sh
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
```
 > Change the setting -> SELINUX=disabled
