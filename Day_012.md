# Day 12: Linux Network Services
Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 8083 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

* Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

* Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:8083 command from jump host.

## Solution
SSH to App server 1 and check the status of httpd
```sh
ssh tony@stapp01
systemctl status httpd
httpd -t
```

Then go to httpd.conf by typing `vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, Verify `ServerName 172.16.238.10:8083`


Check the network port status
```sh
sudo netstat -anp | grep LISTEN |grep ":8083"
```


Kill the process using pid number displayed from above command
```sh
kill -9 <pid_number>
```


Restart httpd service
```sh
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd
```


Accept the port using iptables
```sh
iptables -A INPUT 1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8083 -j ACCEPT
```


Test `curl http://stapp01:8083` command from jump host
