# Day 51: Execute Rolling Updates in Kubernetes
An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image `nginx:1.19` with the latest updates.

* Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the `nginx:1.19` image. The deployment is named `nginx-deployment`.

* Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster



## Solution
On jump host, create a dep.yaml file
```sh
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml > dep.yaml
```

Modify the image in dep.yaml file
> vi dep.yaml, change image `nginx:1.14` to `nginx:1.19`


Now apply the changes in dep.yaml file
```sh
kubectl apply -f dep.yaml
```

Restart the deployment
```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment nginx-deployment
```


Verify deployment pods are in running state
```sh
kubectl get pods
```
