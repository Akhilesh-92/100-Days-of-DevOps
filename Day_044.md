# Day 44: Creating a Docker Compose File
The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

* On App Server 1 in Stratos DC create a container named `httpd` using a docker compose file `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` (please use the exact name for file).

* Use `httpd` (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as `httpd`; you can use any name for service.

* Map `80` number port of container with port `3003` of docker host.

* Map container's `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` volume with `/opt/devops` volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).



## Solution
1. Write a Docker Compose File on App Server 1 by creating `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml`.
```sh
```version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "3003:80"                                         
    volumes:
      - /opt/devops:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs         
      - ./httpd_logs:/var/log/httpd                  
    restart: always
```


2. Create the container and verify it is in running state
```sh
docker-compose -f /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker ps
```
