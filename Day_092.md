# Day 92: Managing Jinja2 Templates Using Ansible

One of the Nautilus DevOps team members is working on to develop a role for httpd installation and configuration. Work is almost completed, however there is a requirement to add a jinja2 template for index.html file. Additionally, the relevant task needs to be added inside the role. The inventory file ~/ansible/inventory is already present on jump host that can be used. Complete the task as per details mentioned below:

- Update ~/ansible/playbook.yml playbook to run the `httpd` role on App Server 3.

- Create a jinja2 template `index.html.j2` under `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/` directory and add a line `This file was created using Ansible on <respective server>` (for example This file was created using Ansible on stapp01 in case of App Server 1). Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. Instead, use `inventory_hostname` variable to fetch the correct value.

- Add a task inside `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml` to copy this template on App Server 3 under `/var/www/html/index.html`. Also make sure that `/var/www/html/index.html` file's permissions are `0777`.

- The user/group owner of `/var/www/html/index.html` file must be respective sudo user of the server (for example tony in case of stapp01).

> Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.


## Solution
1. Update playbook.yml with below contents `vi playbook.yml`
```
---
- name: Apply httpd role on servers
  hosts: stapp03
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  roles:
    - role/httpd
```


2. Create a jinja2 template and add below line by `vi /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2`
```
 This file was created using Ansible on {{ inventory_hostname }}
```


3. Add below contents in main.yml `vi role/httpd/tasks/main.yml`
```
 - name: Deploy index.html from Jinja2 template on appserver3
  template:
    src: index.html.j2    
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    mode: '0777'
    owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
  when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"
```


4. Execute the playbook command 
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```


5. Verify by logging into each app server
```
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ ls -la /var/www/html
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 25 02:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Oct 25 02:46 ..
-rwxrwxrwx 1 tony tony   57 Oct 25 02:47 index.html
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ 
```
