# Day 65: Deploy Redis Deployment on Kubernetes

The Nautilus application development team observed some performance issues with one of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes cluster. After looking into number of factors, the team has suggested to use some in-memory caching utility for DB service. After number of discussions, they have decided to use Redis. Initially they would like to deploy Redis on kubernetes cluster for testing and later they will move it to production. Please find below more details about the task:

Create a redis deployment with following parameters:

* Create a config map called `my-redis-config` having maxmemory `2mb` in `redis-config`.

* Name of the deployment should be `redis-deployment`, it should use `redis:alpine` image and container name should be `redis-container`. Also make sure it has only `1` replica.

* The container should request for `1` CPU.

Mount 2 volumes:

a. An Empty directory volume called `data` at path `/redis-master-data`.

b. A configmap volume called `redis-config` at path `/redis-master`.

c. The container should expose the port `6379`.

Finally, `redis-deployment` should be in an up and running state. 
> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
1. On jump host, Create a deployemnt usng below yaml file
```sh
kubectl create deployment redis-deployment --image=redis:alpine --replicas=1 --dry-run=client -o yaml > dep.yaml
```

2. Update dep.yaml with following details
```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: redis-deployment
  name: redis-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis-deployment
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: redis-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: redis:alpine
        name: redis-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /redis-master-data
          name: data
        - mountPath: /redis-master
          name: redis-config
      volumes:
      - name: data
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: redis-config
        configMap:
          name: my-redis-config
      restartPolicy: Always
```


3. Create a config map using yaml contents below
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-redis-config
data:
  redis-config: |
    maxmemory 2mb
```

4. Verify the deployment is running
```sh
kubectl get deploy 
```
