# Day 42: Create Docker Network
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

* Create a docker network named as `ecommerce` on App Server 1 in Stratos DC.
* Configure it to use `bridge` drivers.
* Set it to use subnet `10.10.1.0/24` and iprange `10.10.1.0/24`.


## Solution
1. Create a Docker network on App server 1
```sh
docker network create -d "bridge" --subnet "10.10.1.0/24" --ip-range "10.10.1.0/24" ecommerce
```

2. Verify the created network 
```sh
docker network ls
```
