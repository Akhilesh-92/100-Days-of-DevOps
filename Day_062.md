# Day 62: Manage Secrets in Kubernetes
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy some tools in Kubernetes cluster. Some of the tools are licence based so that licence information needs to be stored securely within Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, the team wants to utilize Kubernetes secrets to store those secrets. Below you can find more details about the requirements:

* We already have a secret key file `news.txt` under `/opt` location on jump host. Create a generic secret named `news`, it should contain the password/license-number present in `news.txt` file.

* Also create a pod named `secret-datacenter`.

* Configure pod's spec as container name should be `secret-container-datacenter`, image should be `ubuntu` with `latest` tag (remember to mention the tag with image). Use sleep command for container so that it remains in running state. Consume the created secret and mount it under `/opt/cluster` within the container.

* To verify you can exec into the container `secret-container-datacenter`, to check the secret key under the mounted path `/opt/cluster`. Before hitting the Check button please make sure pod/pods are in running state, also validation can take some time to complete so keep patience.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
Create a generic secret
```sh
kubectl create secret generic news --from-file=/opt/news.txt
```

Create a pod.yaml file 
```sh
kubectl run secret-datacenter --image=ubuntu:latest --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```


Update pod.yaml with details given below
```spec:
  containers:
  - image: ubuntu:latest
    name: secret-container-datacenter
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo hello; sleep 5;done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      readOnly: true
      mountPath: "/opt/cluster"
    resources: {}
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: news
```


Create a pod using updated pod.yaml file
```
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
kubectl logs -f pods/secret-datacenter
```


Verify the container for the mounted file
```sh
kubectl exec pods/secret-datacenter -c secret-container-datacenter -- cat /opt/cluster/news.txt
```
