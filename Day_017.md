# Day 17: Install and Configure PostgreSQL
The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

PostgreSQL database server is already installed on the Nautilus database server.

* Create a database user `myuser` and set its password to `mypassword`.
* Create a database `mydb` and grant full permissions to user `myuser` on this database.
> Please do not try to restart PostgreSQL server service.

## Solution
SSH to Nautilus database server
```sh
sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE mydb OWNER myuser;"
sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;"
```
