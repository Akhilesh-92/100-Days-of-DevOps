# Day 64: Fix Python App Deployed on Kubernetes Cluster

One of the DevOps engineers was trying to deploy a python app on Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, due to some mis-configuration, the application is not coming up. Please take a look into it and fix the issues. Application should be accessible on the specified nodePort.

* The deployment name is `python-deployment-devops`, its using `poroko/flask-demo-appimage`. The deployment and service of this app is already deployed.
* nodePort should be `32345` and `targetPort` should be python flask app's default port.
> Note: The kubectl on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
1. Verify the image name `poroko/flask-demo-app` in dep.yaml and check image exists in docker hub or not
```sh
kubectl get deployments.apps python-deployment-devops -o yaml > dep.yaml
```
> Correct the image and save the dep.yaml file, which should recreate pod.


2. Verify the port in svc should match deployment port, and correct NodePort `32345`.
And modify port in service only to match container's port.
