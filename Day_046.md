# Day 46: Deploy an App on Docker Containers
The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task:

* On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file `/opt/itadmin/docker-compose.yml` (should be named exactly).

* The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below:

For web service:
* Container name must be `php_web`.
* Use image `php` with any apache tag. Check docker hub for more details.
* Map php_web container's port `80` with host port `8086`
* Map php_web container's `/var/www/html` volume with host volume `/var/www/html`.

For DB service:
* Container name must be `mysql_web`.
* Use image `mariadb` with any tag (preferably latest). Check mariadb for more details.
* Map mysql_web container's port `3306` with host port `3306`
* Map mysql_web container's `/var/lib/mysql` volume with host volume `/var/lib/mysql`.
* Set `MYSQL_DATABASE=database_web` and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections.

After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command `curl <server-ip or hostname>:6400/`

For more details check mariadb.

Note: Once you click on FINISH button, all currently running/stopped containers will be destroyed and stack will be deployed again using your compose file.


## Solution
Create a docker compose file `/opt/itadmin/docker-compose.yml` on App Server 2
```sh
services:
  web:
    image: php:7.2-apache
    container_name: php_web
    ports:
      - "8086:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/www/html:/var/www/html
    restart: always

  db:
    image: mariadb:latest 
    container_name: mysql_web
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: database_web
      MYSQL_USER: app_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: Pass@123*#
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootsecret
```


Execute the docker compose and create containers and verify the connecton
```sh
docker compose -f /opt/itadmin/docker-compose.yml up -d
curl http://localhost/172.16.238.12:8086/
```
