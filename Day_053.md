# Day 53: Resolve VolumeMounts Issue in Kubernetes
We encountered an issue with our Nginx and PHP-FPM setup on the Kubernetes cluster this morning, which halted its functionality. Investigate and rectify the issue:

* The pod name is `nginx-pod` and configmap name is `nginx-config`. Identify and fix the problem.

* Once resolved, copy `/home/thor/index.php` file from the jump host to the `nginx-container` within the nginx document root. After this, you should be able to access the website using Website button on the top bar.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
On jump host, get the pod.yaml
```sh
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml > pod.yaml
```

In pod.yaml file, modify the nginx document root
> vi pod.yaml, go to nginx-container, Modify volumeMounts: `/usr/share/nginx` --> `/var/www/html`


Delete the existing pod and recreate the updated pod.yaml
```sh
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```


Copy `/home/thor/index.php` file from jump host to `nginx-container` within the nginx document root
```sh
kubectl cp /home/thor/index.php nginx-pod:/var/www/html -c nginx-container
```


Inside the container, verify the website accessibility
```sh
kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -c nginx-container -- curl http://localhost:8099
```
