# Day 43: Docker Ports Mapping
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:

* Pull `nginx:alpine-perl` docker image on Application Server 1.

* Create a container named `blog` using the image you pulled.

* Map host port `3000` to container port `80`. Please keep the container in running state.



## Soluton
SSH to App server 1 and execute below commands
```sh
docker pull nginx:alpine-perl
docker run -d --name blog -p 3000:80 nginx:alpine-perl
docker ps
```
