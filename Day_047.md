# Day 47: Docker Python App

A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 1. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 1. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:

* Create a Dockerfile under `/python_app` directory:
  * Use any python image as the base image.
  * Install the dependencies using `requirements.txt` file.
  * Expose the port `8086`.
  * Run the `server.py` script using `CMD`.
* Build an image named `nautilus/python-app` using this Dockerfile.
* Once image is built, create a container named `pythonapp_nautilus`:
  * Map port `8092` of the container to the host port `8096`.
* Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 1.


## Solution
1. SSH to App server 1 and cd into the `/python_app` directory
```sh
ssh tony@Ir0nM@n
cd /python_app
```


2. Create a Dockerfile here in `/python_app` directory and dump the following
```
FROM python:alpine
COPY src/ .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8086
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```


3. Build an image and create a contaner
```sh
docker build -t nautilus/python-app
docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8092:8086 nautilus/python-app
```


4. Verify the python application
```sh
curl http://localhost:8092/
```
