# Day 96: Create EC2 Instance Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance using Terraform with the following requirements:

1. The name of the instance must be `devops-ec2`.

2. Use the Amazon Linux `ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd` to launch this instance.

3. The Instance type must be `t2.micro`.

4. Create a new RSA key named `devops-kp`.

5. Attach the default (available by default) security group.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to provision the instance.

> Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.


## Solution
1. Create a main.tf file and update below contents
```
resource "tls_private_key" "rsa_private_key" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits = 4096
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "devops-kp" {
  key_name = "devops-kp"
  public_key = tls_private_key.rsa_private_key.public_key_openssh
}

data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true 
}

data "aws_security_group" "default" {
  name = "default"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id
}

resource "aws_instance" "devops-ec2" {
  ami = "ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name = aws_key_pair.devops-kp.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [data.aws_security_group.default.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "devops-ec2"
  }
}
```


2. Execute Terraform commands to create the resources
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

3. Verify the resource creation 
```
terraform state list
```
