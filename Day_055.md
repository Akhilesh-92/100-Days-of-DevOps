# Day 55: Kubernetes Sidecar Containers

We have a web server container running the nginx image. The access and error logs generated by the web server are not critical enough to be placed on a persistent volume. However, Nautilus developers need access to the last 24 hours of logs so that they can trace issues and bugs. Therefore, we need to ship the access and error logs for the web server to a log-aggregation service. Following the separation of concerns principle, we implement the Sidecar pattern by deploying a second container that ships the error and access logs from nginx. Nginx does one thing, and it does it well—serving web pages. The second container also specializes in its task—shipping logs. Since containers are running on the same Pod, we can use a shared emptyDir volume to read and write logs.

* Create a pod named `webserver`.

* Create an `emptyDir` volume `shared-logs`.

* Create two containers from `nginx` and `ubuntu` images with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e `nginx:latest`, nginx container name should be `nginx-container` and ubuntu container name should be `sidecar-container` on webserver pod.

* Add command on `sidecar-container`
```
"sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"
```

* Mount the volume `shared-logs` on both containers at location `/var/log/nginx`, all containers should be up and running.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



## Solution
1. On jump host, create a pod.yaml file
```sh
kubectl run webserver --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
```


2. Modify the pod.yaml file in the containers section like below
```
containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: nginx-container
    resources: {}
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
  - image: ubuntu:latest
    name: sidecar-container
    resources: {}
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
  volumes:
  - name: shared-logs
    emptyDir: {}
```


3. Create a pod using updated pod.yaml file
```sh
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
```


4. Verify the pod is in running state and also verify logs shipped by sidecar container
```sh
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs webserver -c sidecar-container
kubectl logs -f webserver -c sidecar-container
```
