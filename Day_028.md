# Day 28: Git Cherry Pick

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository `/opt/official.git`. This repo is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos` on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:

> There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.


## Solution
1. SSH into the Storage server and cd into the repo
```sh
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
git checkout master
```

2. Note the commit ID of the commit by using the message `Update info.txt`
```sh
git log feature --oneline
```

3. Cherry pick the changes of commit into the master branch and push the changes
```sh
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d
git push origin master
```
