# Day 40: Docker Execution
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:

* Install `apache2` in `ubuntu_latest` container using apt that is running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

* Configure Apache to listen on port `5001` instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.

* Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in `running` state at the end.


## Solution
SSH to App Server 1 
```sh
docker exec -it ubuntu_latest /bin/bash
```


Execute the below commands inside bash shell of `ubuntu_latest` container
```sh
apt install apache2
service apache2 status
apt install vim
```


Edit the apache2 config file and update port to `5001`
> vi /etc/apache2/ports.conf --> Listen 5001
> 
> vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf -->  <VirtualHost *:5001>


Start the apache2 service
```sh
/usr/sbin/apache2ctl start
```


Test the apache2 service
```sh
service apache2 status
curl localhost:6000
```
