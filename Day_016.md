# Day 16: Install and Configure NGINX as Load Balancer
Day by day traffic is increasing on one of the websites managed by the Nautilus production support team. Therefore, the team has observed a degradation in website performance. Following discussions about this issue, the team has decided to deploy this application on a high availability stack i.e on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. They started the migration last month and it is almost done, as only the LBR server configuration is pending. Configure LBR server as per the information given below:

* Install `nginx` on `LBR` server
* Configure load-balancing with the an http context making use of all App Servers. Ensure that you update only the main `Nginx` configuration file located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`
* Make sure you do not update the apache port that is already defined in the apache configuration on all app servers, also make sure apache server is up and running on all app servers
* Once done, you can access the website using StaticApp button on the top bar


## Solution
1. SSH to LBR server and install Nginx
```sh
sudo yum install -y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

2. Edit nginx config file and update the following details
```sh
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
upstream app_servers {
        server stapp01:6200;
        server stapp02:6200;
        server stapp03:6200;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name stlb01;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app_servers;
```

3. Verify the details
```sh
sudo systemctl status httpd
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep -I listen
sudo ss -tulpn | grep -I 6200/httpd
```
