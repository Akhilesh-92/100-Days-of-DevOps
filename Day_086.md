# Day 86: Ansible Ping Module Usage
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user from jump host.

b. There is an inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` on jump host. Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 3, make sure ping works.


## Solution
1. Generate a rsa key and copy it to all servers
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
ssh-copy-id tony@172.16.238.10
ssh-copy-id steve@172.16.238.11
ssh-copy-id banner@172.16.238.12
```

2. Update inventory file with ansible_user for all servers.
```
[appservers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp03  ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

3. On jump host, ping a specific server and validate the output
```
thor@jumphost ~/ansible$ ansible stapp01 -i inventory -m ping stapp01
SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
