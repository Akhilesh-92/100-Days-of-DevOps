# Day 14: Linux Process Troubleshooting

The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

> Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not have hosted any code yet on these servers, so you don’t need to worry if Apache isn’t serving any pages. Just make sure the service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 5000 on all app servers.


# Solution
1. Check the status of httpd and debug
```sh
systemctl status httpd
httpd -t
```

> Then go to httpd.conf by typing `vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, Verify `ServerName 172.16.238.10:5000`

2. Verify port listening using `netstat`
```sh
sudo netstat -anp | grep LISTEN |grep ":5000"
```

3. Kill the process 
```sh
kill -9 <pid_number>
```

4. Restart the httpd service
```sh
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd
```
