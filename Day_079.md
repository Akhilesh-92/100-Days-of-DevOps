# Day 79: Jenkins Deployment Job
The Nautilus development team had a meeting with the DevOps team where they discussed automating the deployment of one of their apps using Jenkins (the one in Stratos Datacenter). They want to auto deploy the new changes in case any developer pushes to the repository. As per the requirements mentioned below configure the required Jenkins job.

Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username `admin` and `Adm!n321` password.

Similarly, you can access the Gitea UI using Gitea button, username and password for Git is `sarah` and `Sarah_pass123` respectively. Under user sarah you will find a repository named web that is already cloned on the Storage server under sarah's home. sarah is a developer who is working on this repository.

1. Install `httpd` (whatever version is available in the yum repo by default) and configure it to serve on port `8080` on All app servers. You can make it part of your Jenkins job or you can do this step manually on all app servers.

2. Create a Jenkins job named `nautilus-app-deployment` and configure it in a way so that if anyone pushes any new change to the origin repository in master branch, the job should auto build and deploy the latest code on the Storage server under `/var/www/html` directory. Since `/var/www/html` on Storage server is shared among all apps. Before deployment, ensure that the ownership of the `/var/www/html` directory is set to user sarah, so that Jenkins can successfully deploy files to that directory.

3. SSH into Storage Server using `sarah` user credentials mentioned above. Under sarah user's home you will find a cloned Git repository named `web`. Under this repository there is an `index.html` file, update its content to `Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries`, then push the changes to the `origin` into master branch. This push must trigger your Jenkins job and the latest changes must be deployed on the servers, also make sure it deploys the entire repository content not only `index.html` file.

4. Click on the `App` button on the top bar to access the app, you should be able to see the latest changes you deployed. Please make sure the required content is loading on the main URL `https://<LBR-URL>` i.e there should not be any sub-directory like `https://<LBR-URL>/web` etc.

Note:

1. You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also some times Jenkins UI gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end so in such case please make sure to refresh the UI page.

2. Make sure Jenkins job passes even on repetitive runs as validation may try to build the job multiple times.

3. Deployment related tasks should be done by sudo user on the destination server to avoid any permission issues so make sure to configure your Jenkins job accordingly.

4. For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.


## Solution
1. *Go to Manage Jenkins -> Available Plugins -> SSH Pipeline Steps, Gitea and Pipeline -> Install -> restart Jenkins*

2. *Go to Manage Jenkins -> Available Plugins -> Pipeline (Install this plugin separately and wait until plugin processes all check list) -> Install -> restart Jenkins*

3. *Go to Manage Jenkins -> credentials -> click on system creds -> Add new credential -> Add Storage server username, password, and Name as ID etc.*
```
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15 -p22
sudo yum install -y java-21-openjdk
sudo chown -R natasha:natasha /var/www/html
```

4. *Create a pipeline job to install package -> Add parameters: HOSTNAME, USER, PASSWORD, PACKAGE -> Run pipeline job for each app server*
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('package_install') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def remote = [:]
                    remote.name = "stapp"
                    remote.host = "${HOSTNAME}"
                    remote.user = "${USER}"
                    remote.password = "${PASSWORD}"
                    remote.allowAnyHosts = true
                    
                    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "echo '${PASSWORD}' | sudo -S yum install -y ${PACKAGE}"
                    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "echo '${PASSWORD}' | sudo -S sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 8080/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"
                    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "echo '${PASSWORD}' | sudo -S systemctl enable httpd"
                    sshCommand remote: remote, command: "echo '${PASSWORD}' | sudo -S systemctl start httpd"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

5. *Go to Manage Jenkins -> System -> Gitea Servers*

    * Add Gitea server

    * name: gitea, url: gitea

6. *Go to Manage Jenkins -> Users -> Admin -> Security*

    * Generate API Token 

    * Copy token

7. *Create a freestyle job for deployment*

    * name: nautilus-app-deployment

    * Trigger: Build trigger remotely:

    * BUILD TOKEN: kodekloud, anything you like

    * Build Steps:
    ```
    rm -rf web
    git clone repo-url 
    cd web
    sshpass -p "storage-server-pass" scp -r -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ./* natasha@ststor01:/var/www/html
    ```

8. *Login into gitea*

    * Repo -> Settings -> webhooks

    * Target URL: `https://admin:<api-token>@<jenkins-url>/job/nautilus-app-deployment/build?token=kodekloud`

    * Example: `https://admin:11a3bafd516952ecf4b9103a02348f653c@8080-port-3c6aqh4fy2nkx3vf.labs.kodekloud.com/job/nautilus-app-deployment/build?token=kodekloud`

    * Save and Test Delivery

9. *Login into storage server* 

    * Give permission to natasha
    ```
    sudo chown -R natasha:natasha /var/www/html
    ```

    * Switch user sarah
    ```
    sudo su sarah
    cd /home/sarah/web
    ```

    * Modify index.html and push
