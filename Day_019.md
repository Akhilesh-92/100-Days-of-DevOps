# Day 19: Install and Configure Web Application

xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

* Install `httpd` package and dependencies on `app server 1`.
* Apache should serve on port `3003`.
* There are two website's backups `/home/thor/media` and `/home/thor/cluster` on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that official should work on the link `http://localhost:3003/media/` and games should work on link `http://localhost:3003/cluster/` on the mentioned app server.
* Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e `curl http://localhost:3003/media/` and `curl http://localhost:3003/cluster/`.

## Solution
1. First install `httpd` package and dependencies on `app server 1`.
```sh
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

> Update port in httpd config file using command `sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`, Verify `Listen 3003`

2. Restart httpd
```sh
sudo httpd -t
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

3. On Jump host, copy the backup files to app server 1
```sh
scp /home/thor/media tony@172.16.238.10:/var/www/html/media/index.html
scp /home/thor/cluster tony@172.16.238.10:/var/www/html/cluster/index.html
```

4. Verify the same using curl commands
```sh
curl http://localhost:3003/media/
curl http://localhost:3003/cluster/
```
