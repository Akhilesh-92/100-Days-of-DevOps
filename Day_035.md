# Day 35: Setup Docker Installation

The Nautilus DevOps team aims to containerize various applications following a recent meeting with the application development team. They intend to conduct testing with the following steps:

* Install docker-ce and docker compose packages on `App Server 1`.
* Initiate the docker service.


# Solution
1. SSH to App Server 1 and add docker repo first
```sh
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```


2. Install docker-ce, enable and start it.
```sh
sudo yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
docker --version
```


3. Finally, install docker compose and verify version
```sh
sudo yum install -y docker-compose-plugin
docker compose version
```
