One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:

* Create an image `official:devops` on Application Server 2 from a container `ubuntu_latest` that is running on same server.


## Solution
SSH to App server 2 and create an image from `ubuntu_latest` container
```sh
docker commit ubuntu_latest official:devops
```

Verify image is created or not by using below command.
```sh
docker images
```
