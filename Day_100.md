# Day 100: Create and Configure Alarm Using CloudWatch Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team has been tasked with setting up an EC2 instance for their application. To ensure the application performs optimally, they also need to create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the instance's CPU utilization. The alarm should trigger if the CPU utilization exceeds 90% for one consecutive 5-minute period. To send notifications, use the SNS topic named nautilus-sns-topic, which is already created.

1. Launch EC2 Instance: Create an EC2 instance named `xfusion-ec2` using any appropriate Ubuntu AMI (you can use AMI `ami-0c02fb55956c7d316`).

2. Create CloudWatch Alarm: Create a CloudWatch alarm named `xfusion-alarm` with the following specifications:

    - Statistic: `Average`
    - Metric: `CPU Utilization`
    - Threshold: `>= 90%` for `1` consecutive `5-minute` period
    - Alarm Actions: Send a notification to the `xfusion-sns-topic` SNS topic.
3. Update the `main.tf` file (do not create a separate .tf file) to create a EC2 Instance and CloudWatch Alarm.

4. Create an `outputs.tf` file to output the following values:

    - `KKE_instance_name` for the EC2 instance name.
    - `KKE_alarm_name` for the CloudWatch alarm name.

Notes:

1. The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`.

2. Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

3. Before submitting the task, ensure that terraform plan returns No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.


## Solution
1. Create a main.tf file and add below contents
```
resource "aws_sns_topic" "sns_topic" {
    name = "xfusion-sns-topic"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2_instance" {
    ami = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
        Name = "xfusion-ec2"
    }
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cw_alarm" {
    alarm_name = "xfusion-alarm"
    comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
    evaluation_periods = 1
    metric_name = "CPUUtilization"
    namespace = "AWS/EC2"
    period = 300
    statistic = "Average"
    threshold = 90

    dimensions = {
        InstanceId = aws_instance.ec2_instance.id
    }

    alarm_actions = [aws_sns_topic.sns_topic.arn]
}
```

2. Create a outputs.tf file and add below contents
```
output "KKE_instance_name" {
    value = aws_instance.ec2_instance.tags["Name"]
}

output "KKE_alarm_name" {
    value = aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.cw_alarm.alarm_name
}
```

3. Execute the Terraform commands to create the required resources
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
