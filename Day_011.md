# Day 11: Install and Setup Tomcat Server
The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

* Install tomcat server on App Server 2.
* Configure it to run on port 3000.
* There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.
Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp02:3000

## Solution
1. SSH into App Server 2 and Install Tomcat
```sh
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y
sudo yum install -y tomcat
```

2. Change port number in the tomcat configuration file, sudo vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml → Port 3000
Start and enable tomcat
```sh
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
sudo systemctl status tomcat
```

3. Copy ROOT.war file on Jump host to /tmp on App server 2 
```sh
scp /tmp/ROOT.war steve@stapp02:/tmp/
```

4. Move ROOT.war file from /tmp to /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ on App server 2
```sh
sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
```

5. Change owner and permissions on ROOT.war file
```sh
sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
```

6. Test the app
```sh
curl http://stapp02:3000/
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```
