# Day 59: Troubleshoot Deployment Issues in Kubernetes

Last week, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a redis app on Kubernetes cluster, which was working fine so far. This morning one of the team members was making some changes in this existing setup, but he made some mistakes and the app went down. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please take a look.

* The deployment name is `redis-deployment`. The pods are not in running state right now, so please look into the issue and fix the same.
> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


## Solution
1. On jump host, get the list of pods and describe it
```sh
kubectl get po
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```


2. Edit the deployment, verify the image and configmap names
```sh
kubectl edit deployment <dep-name>
```
> Check the details in spec section, observe the configmap name


3. Verify the confgmap resource
```sh
kubectl get cm
```
> Verify configmap name and correct it in deployment.


4. Verify the pod status now
```sh
kubectl get po -w
```
