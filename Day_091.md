# Day 91: Ansible Lineinfile Module

The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.

We already have an inventory file under `/home/thor/ansible directory` on jump host. Write a playbook `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:

1. Install `httpd` web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.
2. Create a file `/var/www/html/index.html` with content:

    ```
    This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!
    ```

3. Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in `/var/www/html/index.html` file. Below is the content:

    ```
    Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!
    ```

    Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

4. The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's `user` and `group` owner should be `apache` on all app servers.

5. The `/var/www/html/index.html` file's permissions should be `0644` on all app servers.

> Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.


## Solution
Add the playbook contents as below
```
