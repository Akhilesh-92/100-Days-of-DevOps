# Day 68: Set Up Jenkins Server
The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:

1. Install Jenkins on the jenkins server using the `yum` utility only, and start its service.
    * If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, refer to [this](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/systemd-services/#starting-services).
2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `John` and email should be `john@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.


## Solution
Login to Jenkins server and execute below commands
```
ssh root@jenins -p22
sud yum install -y wget
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade
```


Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
```
sudo yum install fontconfig java-21-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```


Copy the password 
```
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
e1d37a753e1e4f449eeffcd87707cd68
```

> Install recommended plugins
>  and enter admin details and email.
