# Day 15: Setup SSL for NGINX
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

* Install and configure `nginx` on `App Server 3`.

* On App Server 3 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location `/tmp/nautilus.crt` and `/tmp/nautilus.key`. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

* Create an index.html file with content `Welcome!` under Nginx document root.

* For final testing try to access the App Server 3 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example `curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/`.

## Solution
1. Install `nginx` service on `App Server 3`
```sh
sudo yum install -y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

> Edit nginx config file, `sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, uncomment server dict

2. Copy `.crt` and `.key` contents to `/etc/pki/nginx/server.crt` and `/etc/pki/nginx/private/server.crt` respectively
```sh
sudo cp /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/pki/nginx/server.crt
sudo cp /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/pki/nginx/private/server.crt
```

3. Create index.html file and write the content `Welcome!`
```sh
grep root /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

4. Verify the access 
```sh
curl -k https://172.16.238.12
```
