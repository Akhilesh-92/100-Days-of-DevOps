# Day 89: Ansible Manage Services

Developers are looking for dependencies to be installed and run on Nautilus app servers in Stratos DC. They have shared some requirements with the DevOps team. Because we are now managing packages installation and services management using Ansible, some playbooks need to be created and tested. As per details mentioned below please complete the task:

a. On jump host create an Ansible playbook `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` and configure it to install `httpd` on all app servers.

b. After installation make sure to `start` and `enable` `httpd` service on all app servers.

c. The inventory `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` is already there on jump host.

d. Make sure user `thor` should be able to run the playbook on jump host.

> Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.


## Solution
1. Create a playbook.yml n `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` location and update below contents
```
---
- name: Install a package using yum
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    
    - name: Ensure httpd service is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

2. Apply the playbook.yml with below command
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```
